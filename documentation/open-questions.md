# Open Questions

## Application
* What other similar applications are currently in use?  

* What are other lines of work where this application could be used?  
Any courier service type work can utilize this application. For example, calling for a taxi, on-demand delivery systems, etc.

* What articles has been written about this topic/services?  

## Process
* When performing a pick up and/or drop off, what information do we need?  
Who is the mother?  
Where is the mother located?  
How much milk does the mother have?  
Which courier is doing the pick up?  

* How do we allow donor mothers and couriers communicate?  
Text messaging.

* What type of functionality do we need?  
We need to have a central way for donor mothers to report that they have spare BM. We also need a way for couriers to keep track of all the mothers they need to pick up milk from as well as a way to communicate with each other. We also need to store all of the information (logs, donor mother/courier information, status of BM transaction) somewhere that is easily accessible.

* Would it be possible for the person collecting to send a message to the server to confirm milk has been collected?  
Yes.

## Technology
* Do all the phones have to be android phones?  
We assume that the phones used by couriers (our partners) are all android devices.

* Are we using Voxeo?  
It would make sense to use Voxeo at this point. There are currently a number of sample code online for Voxeo.

* What budget do we have for operation costs?  
We currently cannot get any information about this.

* Would it make sense to have an SMS front end?  
For uniformity when donor mothers contact our partners, yes.

* What interfaces do users and couriers currently see in existing dispatching services?  
In-vehicle GPS, apps with maps and notifications

## Work Flow
* How do our partners recruit mothers?  
Many are volunteer mothers who had just given birth at nearby hospitals.

* How do donor mothers tell our partners when they have extra BM for collection?  
The donor mothers send a message to our partners.

* Does the BM need to be picked up the same day our partners are notified by donor mothers? If not, how do you coordinate when's a good time for pickup?  

* How do our partners coordinate and pick up the BM? What interaction happens during BM collection (data collection about the donor mother, etc)?  
`
* What happens after the BM is collected (record keeping, milk processing, etc)?  
The milk is kept with the courier until the courier gets back to one of the bank centers, which is commonly the local hospitals. 

* How does the communication flow work?  
In an individual community, there are specific couriers who work with the donor mothers. When the mother has extra BM, they message the couriers that they have BM ready for pick up. The courier and mother then decide when the best time for them to meet is.

* How is milk banking currently implemented?  

* Currently, how do people in South Africa figure out how to allocate communities to couriers?  
Whomever (courier) is closest to the specific area/community will pick up the BM.

## Misc.
* Who are our stakeholders?  
The dispatcher, courier, and donor mothers.
