# Open Questions

## Application
* What other similar applications are currently in use?  
* What are other lines of work where this application could be used?  
Any courier service type work can utilize this application. For example, calling for a taxi, on-demand delivery systems, etc.

* What articles has been written about this topic/services?  

## Process
* When performing a pick up and/or drop off, what information do we need?  
Who is the mother?  
Where is the mother located?  
How much milk does the mother have?  
Which courier is doing the pick up?  
* How do we allow donor mothers and couriers communicate?  
Text messaging.
* What type of functionality do we need?  
We need to have a central way for donor mothers to report that they have spare BM. We also need a way for couriers to keep track of all the mothers they need to pick up milk from as well as a way to communicate with each other. We also need to store all of the information (logs, donor mother/courier information, status of BM transaction) somewhere that is easily accessible.
* Would it be possible for the person collecting to send a message to the server to confirm milk has been collected?  
Yes.

## Technology
* Do all the phones have to be android phones?  
We assume that the phones used by couriers (our partners) are all android devices.
* Are we using Voxeo?  
It would make sense to use Voxeo at this point. There are currently a number of sample code online for Voxeo.
* What budget do we have for operation costs?  
* Would it make sense to have an SMS front end?  
For uniformity when donor mothers contact our partners, yes.
* What interfaces do users and couriers currently see in existing dispatching services?  

## Work Flow
* How do our partners recruit mothers?  
Many are volunteer mothers who had just given birth at nearby hospitals.
* How do donor mothers tell our partners when they have extra BM for collection?  
The donor mothers send a message to our partners.
* Does the BM need to be picked up the same day our partners are notified by donor mothers? If not, how do you coordinate when's a good time for pickup?  
* How do our partners coordinate and pick up the BM? What interaction happens during BM collection (data collection about the donor mother, etc)?  
* What happens after the BM is collected (record keeping, milk processing, etc)?  
* How does the communication flow work?  
* How is milk banking currently implemented?  
* Currently, how do people in South Africa figure out how to allocate communities to couriers?  
Whomever (courier) is closest to the specific area/community will pick up the BM.

## Misc.
* Who are our stakeholders?  
The dispatcher, courier, and donor mothers.
