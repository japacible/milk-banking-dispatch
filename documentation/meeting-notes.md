### Possible Interview Group Members:  
* PATH Seattle  
* South Africa  

### Winter 2013 Goals:  
* Brainstorm & evolve idea
* Learn about processes from partners to guide implementation

### New Open Questions:  
* How do they recruit mothers?  
* How do donor mothers tell our partners when they have extra BM for collection? 
* How do our partners coordinate and pick up the BM? What interaction happens during BM collection (i.e. data collection about the donor mother etc )?  
* What happens after the BM is collected (in terms of record keeping, milk processing etc)?  
* Do all the phones have to be android phones?  
* Would it be possible for the person collecting to send a message to the server to confirm milk has been collected?  
* How do we allow donor mothers and collectors communicate?  

### Summary of Problem & Idea:  
This comes from an email thread between Rohit, Penny, and Lizzie. Open questions have been documented under the Open Questions section rather than this section.

#### Current Process:  
* Word about milk banking and donating BM spreads by mouth  
* Phone calls from moms & hospitals  
* Coordinate & rush to pick up BM (2-5 people in Durban)  

#### Potential Expansion of Program:  
* Expand to 20-50 people / spread across larger area  
* Use of technology for DBM collection by location tracking
* Scale up to be implemented across the country

#### Current Use of Technology:
* Server that archives pasteurization data

#### Potential Use of Technology:  
* Location-aware mobile phones  
* Phone could tell if/when DBM is available for collection near your location  
* Server could also track location via mobile  
  * Hospital/donor mothers send message to the server when they have extra BM  
  * Server sends message to whomever is closest to location for BM collection  

#### Situations Eliminated by Location Tracking Implementation:  
* You just get back from an area and someone calls to say they have milk for you too... so back you go.  

#### Situations:  
* So the donor moms just access the server via internet and then a message is sent to the person collecting.  
* The donor mom and collector communicate to know what time the milk could be collected, as moms are often not at home. 
  * Moms could select a time slot when they message to say milk is ready  
* Multiple volunteers for area  

### //TODO:  
* Set up a meeting time (Rohit + team) [DONE]  

## 2.15.2013: Email (Rohit)  
Next Meeting: 2.20.2013: 1630 @ Atrium  

### Similar Idea In Place: Taxi Dispatch  
* 2-way radios  
* Might not have a location tracking component  
* Similar idea:  
  * Customer calls cab company  
  * Dispatcher finds a cab closest to pickup location
