###Cover Picture
- (Could use diagram of the milk banking process from Rohit's paper)

###Problem space
- Couriers at the milk bank have to drop whatever their doing for pickup once notified of a donor having extra breast milk (BM)
- Currently there is no organization for who gets dispatched for the pickup
- Our hope is that this will make the couriers job easier during pickup

###Project description
- We have been working with PATH and people in South Africa

###Related work
- Dispatch! app

###Findings so far

###Basic scenario
- Donor mother calls the MB
- She uses an IVR system to tell the MB where she is
- Our app gets this information and determines which courier is best suited at the time
- Courier goes to donor's location
- Courier lets the mother know when (s)he is close
- Courier collects BM and any other information needed
- While the courier is out, if another pickup request is made, the courier will be notified
