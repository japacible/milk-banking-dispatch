##Questions

####General:
* describe the current workflow
* describe the problem as you see it
* describe possible solutions / what has been brainstormed so far

####these apply to mothers, curriers, and dispatchers:

* what is the his/her role in the system – what does he/she do now?
* what would simplify his/her task?
* what role would he/she play in the new system?
* what are his/her constraints (technology, time, etc)?

####Logistics:
* How are the mothers and the curriers recruited?
* How well do curriers know the neighborhood?
* How much area do they cover?

* Any other major points that we’ve missed…
 
##Answers

####The two main points that came from the conversation seem to be as follows 

1.  The system (or lack of system) is very ad-hoc at the moment.  Individual roles (such a courier and dispatcher) don’t exist.  It’s a collection of volunteers working with the university.  Kiersten seemed to think that the lack of organization would make implementing this project in the current environment impossible.
2.	This is something we might want to target at Cape Town rather than Durban (which is where PATH is operating).  Cape Town has much stronger infrastructure in place, which could possibly (though we don’t know) support this system.

####Discussion about further communication:	

1.	Lizzie would know the answers to workflow problems (the first section on the list), although would probably have difficulty with the later questions (because a system just doesn’t exist).  Worth talking to her, but mostly about the general nature of the system.
2.	We need to speak with Rohit further about the workflow that he sees at the moment, and where specifically he’s talking about setting this system up.
3.	Kiersten suggested it’s worth having Rohit contact people before we talk to them so he can describe more specifically what we’re proposing.

####Other data:

1.	Donating mothers are usually healthy mothers who are staying in the hospital
2.	There are some wealthy donors who donate from home, though they are not common
3.	Simplifying the process for the donor would be useful
4.	Couriers are volunteers who get a phone and must interrupt what they’re doing
5.	In relation to the above, there are a number of different workflows among the different organizations
6.	South Africa probably isn’t ready for this system at this point in time.  Lack of infrastructure as well as a concrete “system/workflow” prevents implementation.  However, it’s something worth considering for a few years down the road and could be quite helpful when the milk banking operation is scaled.
