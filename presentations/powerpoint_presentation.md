### Cover Picture
* Potential ideas
  * Diagram of milk banking process from Rohit's paper
  * Stock photo

### Problem Space
* Couriers at the milk bank (MB) have to drop whatever their doing for pickup once notified of a donor having extra breast milk (BM)
* Currently there is no organization for who gets dispatched for the pickup
* Our hope is that this will make the couriers job easier during pickup

### Project Description
* Our project organizes the dispatching of couriers who collect the BM
* Donor mothers and courriers will use it for deliveries
* Hospital will use it to gather information

### Related work
* Idea comes from Decentralized Human Milk Banking with ODK Sensors by Rohit Chaudri and Gaetano Borriello among others
* Dispatch! app for taxi drivers

### Findings so far
* We have been working with
  * Rohit
  * PATH
  * Human Milk Banking Association of South Africa in Durban
* Currently there is no infrastructure

### Basic scenario (must be diagrams)
* Donor mother calls the MB
* She uses an IVR system to tell the MB where she is
* Our app gets this information and determines which courier is best suited at the time
* Courier goes to donor's location
* Courier lets the mother know when (s)he is close
* Courier collects BM and any other information needed
* While the courier is out, if another pickup request is made, the courier will be notified
